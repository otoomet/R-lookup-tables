# Introduction

Asymptote is an excellent tool to greate more complex editable
graphs.  However, the documentation is thin and very hard to
navigate.  Here are some notes.


# Command line usage {#command-line-usage}

## Output formats

Output formats can be specified
```
asy -f <format>
```

At least these formats are supported: 

* **eps** (default)
* **pdf**
* **jpg**: uses imagemagick to convert to jpg.  Ensure you imagemagick
  policies are permissive enough!
* **png**: uses transparent background


# Data structures


# Drawing {#drawing}

## Drawing paths {#drawing-paths}

The main drawing command is `draw`.  It most important arguments are
```
draw(path)
```
If the path contains a single pair, it just draws a dot.  


## Drawing dots {#drawing-dots}

Dots can be drawn with `dot(pair)`.  Dots are drawn using the current
line width, and the width is magnified by system variable
`dotfactor`.  For instance:
```{asy}
dotfactor=10;
dot((1,2));
dot((2,1));
```

The dot is
drawn using the current line width, multiplied but `dotfactor`
(default: 6).


## Adjusting drawings

### Line width

The line width can be adjusted with `linewidth(points)` in the `draw`
command.  E.g. 
```
draw((1,2)--(2,1), linewidth(1));
```
The default line width is 0.5, it can be changed with, e.g.
```
defaultpen(linewidth(1))
```


# Labels

## Labeling points

The basic way to add labels to points is with

```
label(Label L, pair position, align align, pen p, filltype filltype)
```

* **L** is a text string that may contain latex.  It may also be a
  dedicated _Label_ object.
* **position** is the point location we are labeling.
* **align** is the location of label with respective to the position.
  By default, the label is centered at the position.  This should be a
  vector (_pair_) that indicates the position of the closest corner of
  the lable with respect to the point.
  
  There are a
  number of pre-defined compas directions (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, `SE`, `SW`, `ENE`
  and such) that define the direction where to shift the label away
  from the point by a suitable amount.
  For instance, when using align `NW`, then the label
  is positioned top-right of the position, so that its lower-right
  corner is in the NW direction.
  
  The defined compas directions are just shortcuts for vectors in that
  direction.  These can be scaled and added (e.g. `2*N + E`), and one
  can supply other vectors.  A useful way to create vectors is
  function `dir` that creates an unit vector in given direction (in
  degrees).
* **pen** are typically colors
* **filltype**: the background of a label can be filled with a given
  color, e.g. you may want to specify `Fill(white)` to add a white
  background on a label that is on top of obscured by other elements.

The following image demonstrates a few of these tools:

* The first label is attached to the horizontal spoke, East of it.
  All the pre-defined compas directions can be used in this fashion.
* The second, $30^\circ$ label, is actually labeling the origin,
  but shifted outside of
  the circle.  This is achieved by multiplying the alignment
  vector `dir(30)` by 32.  This number depends on the size and should
  be found by experimenting.
* the third label is attached to the `dir(150)` point, however, to
  the opposite direction (inside of the circle) of it.  The background
  is filled white in order to remove the spoke behind the label.

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/labels-dir-fill.asy", labels="labels-dir-fill")
```
```{r labels-dir-fill, eval=FALSE}
```

This results in

![](asymptote/labels-dir-fill.png)


## Adjusting labels

### Font size

The font size can be adjusted by `fontsize(points)` in the `label`
command.  E.g. 
```
label("$x_1$, (1,2), fontsize(8));
```
The default fontsize is 12, it can be changed with, e.g.
```
defaultpen(fontsize(9))
```


# Frames and pictures {#frames-pictures}

Frames and pictures are a way to repeate certain complex drawings when
potentially transforming those in the process.

## Pictures

Pictures are, well, pictures.

The following example demonstrates how to create a new picture, and
add it to the main picture several times with small modifications.  We
create the main picture that contains a diagonal line, and another
_picture_ object that contains a scaled unit circle.  Thereafter we a)
add the circle-picture on the main picture unchanged, and b) add it
second time, scaled and shifted to the end of the diagonal line:

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/positioning-picture.asy", labels="pos")
```
```{r pos, eval=FALSE}
```

This results in

![](asymptote/positioning-picture.png)

The originally defined _size_ applies
to the new pictures as well, so adding a new picture will
automatically scale in a way that the unit size will be the same as on
the original picture.

## Frames

Frames are somewhat similar to pictures, but it seems one cannot
change _size_ or _unitsize_ on frames.  The result will be in
postscript units.  However, one can use similar `add` function, and
scale frames.


# Coding {#coding}

## Output {#coding-output}

Output to console can be done using `write`, it accepts a list of
arguments that will be printed, no spaces are inserted between the
list items.  It can print various _asymptote_ data
structures, including pairs and paths.  See example in
[Functions](#coding-functions). 

It is limited though in terms of what kind of data structures it can
take and in which order, it will not accept a complex list of strings
and integers.  You can convert those to strings using `string()`,
e.g. 
```
write("x = " + string(x) + ",  y = " + string(y));
```


## Variable types {#coding-vartypes}

The basic variable types are `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`.

The drawing specific variables are `pair`, `path`, `pen`, `transform`

## Casting

Real can be casted to integer as `round(x)`, `floor(x)` and
`ceil(x)`, there is no explicit cast function `int()`.

A number can be casted to sring with `string(x)`.

## For loops

There are two types of for loops, both following the java/C++ style.  The
first one contains the explicit initializer, condition, and increment
statement, all separated by semicolons:
```{java, eval=FALSE}
for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
   // do something
}
```
The other is the "variable : collection" syntax to loop over all
variables in a collection:
```{java, eval=FALSE}
for(pair point : pointlist) {
   // do something
}
```
Note that in both cases the loop variable must be defined inside of
the loop operator.  The loop variable only exists within the loop and
is lost as soon as the loop exits.


## Functions {#coding-functions}

Function definition is fairly similar to function in C++ and java.
You have to declare the return type, and argument types.  Argument
default values are accepted.

Function must return a value--a missing return statement results in an
error, unless the return value is declared as _void_.

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/multiply-function-demo.asy",
                  labels="multiply-function-demo")
```
```{r multiply-function-demo, eval=FALSE}
```

The output is:
```
2*3=6
2*4=8
```
