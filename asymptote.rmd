# Introduction

Asymptote is an excellent tool to greate more complex editable
graphs.  However, the documentation is thin and very hard to
navigate.  Here are some notes.


# Command line usage {#command-line-usage}

## Output formats

Output formats can be specified
```
asy -f <format>
```

At least these formats are supported: 

* **eps** (default)
* **pdf**
* **jpg**: uses imagemagick to convert to jpg.  Ensure you imagemagick
  policies are permissive enough!
* **png**: uses transparent background


# Labels

## Labeling points

The basic way to add labels to points is with

```
label(Label L, pair position, align align, pen p, filltype filltype)
```

* **L** is a text string that may contain latex.  It may also be a
  dedicated _Label_ object.
* **position** is the point location we are labeling.
* **align** is the location of label with respective to the position.
  By default, the label is centered at the position.  This should be a
  vector (_pair_) that indicates the position of the closest corner of
  the lable with respect to the point.
  
  There are a
  number of pre-defined compas directions (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, `SE`, `SW`, `ENE`
  and such) that define the direction where to shift the label away
  from the point by a suitable amount.
  For instance, when using align `NW`, then the label
  is positioned top-right of the position, so that its lower-right
  corner is in the NW direction.
  
  The defined compas directions are just shortcuts for vectors in that
  direction.  These can be scaled and added (e.g. `2*N + E`), and one
  can supply other vectors.  A useful way to create vectors is
  function `dir` that creates an unit vector in given direction (in
  degrees).
* **pen** are typically colors
* **filltype**: the background of a label can be filled with a given
  color, e.g. you may want to specify `Fill(white)` to add a white
  background on a label that is on top of obscured by other elements.

The following image demonstrates a few of these tools:

* The first label is attached to the horizontal spoke, East of it.
  All the pre-defined compas directions can be used in this fashion.
* The second, $30^\circ$ label, is actually labeling the origin,
  but shifted outside of
  the circle.  This is achieved by multiplying the alignment
  vector `dir(30)` by 32.  This number depends on the size and should
  be found by experimenting.
* the third label is attached to the `dir(150)` point, however, to
  the opposite direction (inside of the circle) of it.  The background
  is filled white in order to remove the spoke behind the label.

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/labels-dir-fill.asy", labels="labels-dir-fill")
```
```{r labels-dir-fill, eval=FALSE}
```

This results in

# Frames and pictures {#frames-pictures}

Frames and pictures are a way to repeate certain complex drawings when
potentially transforming those in the process.

## Pictures

Pictures are, well, pictures.

The following example demonstrates how to create a new picture, and
add it to the main picture several times with small modifications.  We
create the main picture that contains a diagonal line, and another
_picture_ object that contains a scaled unit circle.  Thereafter we a)
add the circle-picture on the main picture unchanged, and b) add it
second time, scaled and shifted to the end of the diagonal line:

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/positioning-picture.asy", labels="pos")
```
```{r pos, eval=FALSE}
```

This results in

![](asymptote/positioning-picture.png)

The originally defined _size_ applies
to the new pictures as well, so adding a new picture will
automatically scale in a way that the unit size will be the same as on
the original picture.

## Frames

Frames are somewhat similar to pictures, but it seems one cannot
change _size_ or _unitsize_ on frames.  The result will be in
postscript units.  However, one can use similar `add` function, and
scale frames.


# Coding

## Output

Output to console can be done using `write`, it accepts a list of
arguments that will be printed, no spaces are inserted between the
list items.  It can print various _asymptote_ data
structures, including pairs and paths.  See example in
[Functions](#coding-functions). 


## Functions {#coding-functions}

Function definition is fairly similar to function in C++ and java.
You have to declare the return type, and argument types.  Argument
default values are accepted.

Function must return a value--a missing return statement results in an
error, unless the return value is declared as _void_.

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/multiply-function-demo.asy",
                  labels="multiply-function-demo")
```
```{r multiply-function-demo, eval=FALSE}
```

The output is:
```
2*3=6
2*4=8
```
