# Introduction

Asymptote is an excellent tool to greate more complex editable
graphs.  However, the documentation is thin and very hard to
navigate.  Here are some notes.


# Command line usage {#command-line-usage}

## Output formats

Output formats can be specified
```
asy -f <format>
```

At least these formats are supported: 

* **eps** (default)
* **pdf**
* **jpg**: uses imagemagick to convert to jpg.  Ensure you imagemagick
  policies are permissive enough!
* **png**: uses transparent background


# Frames and pictures {#frames-pictures}

Frames and pictures are a way to repeate certain complex drawings when
potentially transforming those in the process.

## Pictures

Pictures are, well, pictures.

The following example demonstrates how to create a new picture, and
add it to the main picture several times with small modifications.  We
create the main picture that contains a diagonal line, and another
_picture_ object that contains a scaled unit circle.  Thereafter we a)
add the circle-picture on the main picture unchanged, and b) add it
second time, scaled and shifted to the end of the diagonal line:

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/positioning-picture.asy", labels="pos")
```
```{cpp pos, eval=FALSE}
```

This results in

![](positioning-picture.png)

The originally defined _size_ applies
to the new pictures as well, so adding a new picture will
automatically scale in a way that the unit size will be the same as on
the original picture.

## Frames

Frames are somewhat similar to pictures, but it seems one cannot
change _size_ or _unitsize_ on frames.  The result will be in
postscript units.  However, one can use similar `add` function, and
scale frames.


# Coding

## Output

Output to console can be done using `write`, it accepts a list of
arguments that will be printed, no spaces are inserted between the
list items.  It can print various _asymptote_ data
structures, including pairs and paths.  See example in
[Functions](#coding-functions). 


## Functions {#coding-functions}

Function definition is fairly similar to function in C++ and java.
You have to declare the return type, and argument types.  Argument
default values are accepted.

Function must return a value--a missing return statement results in an
error, unless the return value is declared as _void_.

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("asymptote/multiply-function-demo.asy",
                  labels="multiply-function-demo")
```
```{cpp multiply-function-demo, eval=FALSE}
```

The output is:
```
2*3=6
2*4=8
```
