# Introduction

Maxima is a nice computer algebra system, however, the docs are rather
hard to read.

A distinct feature of maxima is that each command must end ended with
a semicolon.  The command is not reacted upon until one enters the
semicolon, it feels as if maxima is not working while in fact it is
just waiting for the semincolon, possibly on a new line.


## Online help

The help can be accessed with

Note space between `?` and the topic, also semicolon is not needed.
Topics can be function names.


# Variables, Functions, and Assignment

## Data types

Matrices can be created using function `matrix` and
wrapping individual lines in brackets:
```{maxima}
matrix([1,2],[3,4]);
```

## Variables

Variables can be assigned as `variable : expression`.  For instance,

```{maxima}
x : 1;
q : 1 - p;
```


# Messing with expressions

## Simplification

`expand` opens parenthesis and collects the relevant items:

```{maxima}
e : (a + b)*(a - b);
expand(e);
```

`ratsimp` attempts to simplify the expression into fractions of
polynomials, including inside of non-rational functions.

```{maxima}
e : a^2 - b^2;
ratsimp(e);
```


# Functions

## linear algebra

* `determinant` (not `det`!)
