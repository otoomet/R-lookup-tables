# Phoronix test suite

Phoronix test suite (PTS) is a testing suite.  Openbenchmarking.org
(OBO) is the website.

## Running tests

Various types of tests can be run with
```sh
phoronix-test-suite benchmark <test>
```
`<test>` may be a single test (e.g. `pts/openarena`), a test suite
(e.g. `renderers`), or a code for existing openbenchmarking test
(e.g. `2110066-PTS-10600KOK66`).

PTS asks a number of questions:

* _Do you want to save these results (Y/n)_
* _Enter a name for the result file:_  The results can be saved in
  different files.  Normally you want to save different tests/suites
  in different files and call the files accordingly (e.g _graphics_ or
  _encoding_).  One file can hold results for multiple test runs.  If
  you upload the results to OBO, then they are displayed one file at
  time.  File name cannot be the same as name of the test.  You can
  save results from multiple runs in the same file, i.e. enter name of
  an existing file here.  The runs do not
  have to perform the same tests, but if you put different tests into
  the same file then you cannot really compare the runs anyway, so it
  is kind of moot.
* _Enter a unique name to describe this test run / configuration:_
  Inside of the files, different test runs are distinguished by this
  name.  Here you can put your computer name and tell something about
  the current configuration (e.g. _laptop running on battery_ or
  _no power limits_).  Note that CPU, GPU and other easily obtainable
  data is automatically included.
* PTS may also ask a number of question about the exact test type(s)
  you want to run, e.g. screen resolution or the type of the
  renderer. 

PTS saves the results in folder

`.phoronix-test-suite/test-results/<name-of-the-system>/composite.xml`

You can query the locally saved results by `phoronix-test-suite
list-saved-results`.  See [Manage results](#manage-results)


## Manage results {#manage-results}

The most important PTS commands to manage the results are

* `list-saved-results`
  lists the locally saved results.  The results are
  displayed by test id (in bold) followed by the file name they are
  saved in
  (this is the answer to the
  question _Enter a name for the result file:_ when running a
  benchmark).
  If you just run a single test or a suite then these two are
  the same.  But if you re-run someones else's test (e.g. using the
  OBO bencmark id), then these are
  different.
  It also lists test runs inside the files (answer
  to _Enter a unique name to describe this test run /
  configuration:_).
  
* `remove-result <test id>`  Delete the file, corresponding to the
  test id (the first bold name listed by `list-saved-results`).



## How to create a personal phoronix test suite

```sh
phoronix-test-suite build-suite
```

Asks name, type (system/processor/...)

What is a good test type?  Processor seems too narrow.

Subtests: have to pick from a long list, and can select parameters.
Fills out the test in
`.phoronix-test-suite/test-suites/local/<suite-name>` as an _Execute_
element with tags _Test_ (test name), _Arguments_ and _Description_.
```xml
  <Execute>
    <Test>pts/openarena-1.5.5</Test>
    <Arguments>+set r_customWidth 1920 +set r_customHeight 1080</Arguments>
    <Description>Resolution: 1920 x 1080</Description>
  </Execute>
```
**_Description_ is necessary for the test to obey the arguments**.
Description is printed at the beginning of the test run, you can
change its content, but if the field is not there, it will not run
correctly (may fail to run, or pick wrong set of parameters).


The test suite definition is located in
`.phoronix-test-suite/test-suites/local/<suite-name>` and called
`suite-definition.xml`.  It looks like
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!--Phoronix Test Suite v10.4.0-->
<PhoronixTestSuite>
  <SuiteInformation>
    <Title>general-pc-test</Title>
    <Version>1.0.1</Version>
    <TestType>Processor</TestType>
    <Description>A smallish general test containing single and multiple core tasks, and graphics</Description>
    <Maintainer>Ott Toomet</Maintainer>
    <PreRunMessage></PreRunMessage>
    <PostRunMessage></PostRunMessage>
    <RunMode></RunMode>
  </SuiteInformation>
  <Execute>
    <Test>pts/x265-1.3.0</Test>
    <Mode>BATCH</Mode>
  </Execute>
  ...
</PhoronixTestSuite>
```

When you are ready with the test suite, you can upload it to
openbenchmarking as

```sh
phoronix-test-suite upload-test-suite local/general-pc-test
```

### Rebuilding?

_Rebuild_ is supposed to validate the xml but it messes up the
arguments, and adds
```
<RequiresCoreVersionMin></RequiresCoreVersionMin>
<RequiresCoreVersionMax></RequiresCoreVersionMax>
```
into the file, and now this refuses to upload to openbenchmarking. 

It also changed _Mode_ to _BATCH_ and removed the arguments, so all my
subtest selection was gone.

#### Run the test

```sh
phoronix-test-suite rebuild-test-suite local/general-pc-test
```
